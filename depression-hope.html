              “There were months where getting out of bed felt impossible. A friend kept texting me, even when I didn’t respond. Those small reminders helped me reach out for therapy. Today I celebrate every little win.”

            <blockquote>
              “Depression told me I was alone. Volunteering at a local shelter gave me a purpose for a few hours each week. It didn’t cure everything, but it gave me connection. That was the first step back to hope.”
